# Disabler / Bypasses

If you run version 1.1.4, you can spoof ground fly (collision/always on ground) if you take velocity/fall damage it will allow you to fly in the air for about 5 - 10 seconds before lagging back
(delay transactions)

Also abusing teleports while delaying transactions can also allow you to bypass.
